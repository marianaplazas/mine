I tried to be as faithful as possible to the original code so i keeped the coments\
in the code, I just modify two parts, first the shebang to run the code in local\
and the function int in the range (n, **int**(n/2)) because without this the\
code in python 3.5.2 collapse.

###Algorithms:

the first algorithm that Caleb use is called Κόσκινον Ερατοσθένους or, The Sieve\
of Eratosthenes that he mencioned in the coments, this algorithm attributed to\
the greek polymath: mathematician, geographer, poet, astronomer, and music\
theorist Ἐρατοσθένης ὁ Κυρηναῖος (Eratosthenes of Cyrene) has it's earliest\
mention in the book
