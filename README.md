### Mine: projects for curiosity and fun :octocat:

In this repo you'll find no conected projects, just projects for know more about\
something or just curious application, geek projects or whatever code that\
I found great to relax.

##### [Ex-Machina](https://github.com/marianaplazas/mine/tree/master/Ex-Machina):
Here is the code used by Caleb in the movie Ex Machina to decrypt\
the Nathan's code, also there is a readme that explains a little bit\
about the algorithms used in the code with the anwser and some\
personal comments.
