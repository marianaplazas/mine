### Mine: projects for curiosity and fun :octocat:

In this repo you'll find no conected projects, just projects for know more about something or just curious application, geek projects or whatever code that I found great to relax.

##### [Ex-Machina](https://github.com/marianaplazas/mine/tree/master/Ex-Machina):
Here is the code used by Caleb in the movie Ex Machina to decrypt the Nathan's code, also there is a readme that explains a little bit how it works and the algorithm that is used with personal comments and examples of what is going on in some parts of the program, finally I'll give you the answer or the final output of the code and some curious thing about it but that part is ongoing so I'll finish it later, someday, I swear (welcome to ubuntu)
